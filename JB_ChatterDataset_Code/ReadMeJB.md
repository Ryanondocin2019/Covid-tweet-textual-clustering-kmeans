# Notes: 
### My initial dataset consisted of 1500 tweets which were ideal for visually representing their clusters following vectorization but I'm curious to see how this would fare at the scale of your data set. The Optimal K value will obviously be subject to change as dataset size increases which will introduce the need for further hyperparameter tuning but everything you need to run the code had been included in this file. Reducing the variance value for PCA (0.90 -> 0.85) might also be adviseable for best results.I've included The original Twitter dataset as a reference and the necessary callback file for creating your interactive bokeh plot. Please reach out to me with any questions and I'm looking forward to your results!
